First Exercise Sheet

1) Single-/Double-Proton-Decay: CHECK
	Write a formular that extract the single-/double-proton energies (i think its right)
	Check on the proton-decay and double proton-decay
	Get out the (Z,A) if condition is right (S_2p < 0 and S_p > 0, is this right?)
	
2) Drip lines: CHECK
	Write a formular for liquid drop model
	Look for BE < 0, means that its unbound
	
3) Charge Radii:
	Get out the radii in arrays
	Plot them vs. neutron numbers
	
4) 8+/6+ Ratio: NEED TO LEARN HOW TO OPEN THE FILE
	Check for 8+1 and 6+1 in the same nucleus
	Get out the Energy, Mass number and Z
	
5) Q-Value Half-Life determination: CHECK
	Q-value = Mass-Excess, get out the right binding energy
	Connect Q-value to Half-Life (Geiger Nutall?); Calculate it
