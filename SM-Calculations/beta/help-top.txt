 inputs are:

 fi (x1,x2,y1,y2)  (figure) to make figure box
          x1,x2,y1,y2 is the position on the page
          default is 2.0, 6.5, 4.0, 8.5
          fi must be followed by the next two lines
 xmin,xmax,xtics,xticl,label
 ymin,ymax,ytics,yticl,label
      xmin,xmax are the min,max values for the x-axis data
      ymin,ymax are the min,max values for the y-axis data
      tics is the spacing between small tic-marks
      ticl is the spacing between large (labeled) tic-marks
      label is the axis label information
         x_(ss)  subscript ss
         x$(ss)  superscript ss
         ^s  greek letter s (sigma in this case)
 fr xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax  for range of figure axis labels
 ds line      (data symbol) solid line (default)
    dash X    dashed line X=length of dash (x=1. default)
    linef     line only drawn forward
    lineb     line only drawn backward
    dashf X   dash only drawn forward
    cro XS    cross, XS = size change
    plu XS    plus
    squ XS    square
    cir XS    circle
    fir XS    filled circle
    dia XS    diamond
    gau  XW   gaussian with LINE, XW = width
    gaud XW   gaussian with DASH
    bin  XW   binning with LINE
    bins XW   binning with LINE and summed
    fill      fills in with color
 di           (data input)
              to be followed by list of data X,Y,(DY)
 df f         (data file) data taken from external file f
 dn a,b,c     (data norm) ynew = a*(y^b) 
              c = 1., y = 4pi*(x^2)*y
              c = 2., y = y^2
              c = 3., y = 4pi*(x^4)*y
 dl x,y,text  (data label) "text" put at (x,y)
 dt text      (data type) xy or xydy (xy is the default)
 sa LX,LY,SX,SY  (set axis) (must be before fi)
               L = 0 for linear L = 1 for log (default is 0)
               S = graph label size (default = 1.5)
 nr x1,x2,y1,y2   labels axis only between these values
 3f f         (3d data file) x,y,z, data taken from external file f
 3m x         min,max limits for dataa file color range from external file x
 ax  followed by combination of lrbt -                       labels only these axis
 co name     change color to name
 ls x        change the label size by a factor of x
 sh followed by list of x,y - draws or fills the shape
 ex = end (also EOF)
